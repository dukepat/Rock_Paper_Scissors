Rock Paper Scissors on Ethereum  Introduction  We are going to implement the popular Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game on the blockchain. In case, you don’t know about this game, just search on youtube or watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dsHuU10udY  Paper beats Rock since it can cover the rock  Rock beats Scissors since it can smash the scissors  Scissors beats Paper since it can cut the paper  Draw if both pick the same  Hence, there is a circular winning structure. 

While this is just a game, it highlights important concepts which are used in various applications on the Blockchain like DeFi, Bidding, Trading, Turn-based actions, and more.  The basic idea is that you can play RPS in person since the actions can be synchronized. Moreover, if someone cheats, you can have a third party validate and judge. Now there are multiple apps allowing people to play this or any similar game online but you are then trusting a third party - the app provider.  This project is as much about understanding what’s going on, as it is about making relevant changes to complete the game. Your goal should be to reach a basic familiarity with Solidity while understanding the following two concepts.
